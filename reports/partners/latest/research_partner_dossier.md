# Research Partner Dossier

> Factual partner brief. Simulations, metadata, and cell-level evidence are
> clearly separated from pack-level validation.

## Boundary

- Phase: 4.5 - dashboard and simulation automation active; experimental parsing is emerging
- Claim boundary: Do not treat metadata, fixtures, simulations, or cell-level data as pack-level validated aviation battery performance.
- Ranking enabled: False

## Current Signal

- Aircraft examples: 8
- Propulsion examples: 7
- Dataset candidates: 12
- CMU measurement status: blocked
- Long-haul infeasible cases: 4

## Feasibility Blockers

- No comparable audited pack-level aviation battery measurements are available.
- CMU eVTOL source is cell-level evidence and cannot prove pack sufficiency.
- Manufacturer examples are context records with mixed official/third-party boundaries.
- Long-haul feasibility remains simulation-only and expected-infeasible under current assumptions.
- Candidate ranking is blocked until uncertainty, safety, cycle-life, and system boundaries are audited.

## Collaboration Asks

- Contribute license-cleared datasets with schemas, units, uncertainty, and provenance.
- Help normalize impedance, capacity, temperature, and duty-cycle fields across datasets.
- Audit edge cases that could promote metadata or fixtures into measurement views.
