# Investor or Program Manager Brief

> Factual partner brief. Simulations, metadata, and cell-level evidence are
> clearly separated from pack-level validation.

## Boundary

- Phase: 4.5 - dashboard and simulation automation active; experimental parsing is emerging
- Claim boundary: Do not treat metadata, fixtures, simulations, or cell-level data as pack-level validated aviation battery performance.
- Ranking enabled: False

## Current Signal

- Aircraft examples: 8
- Propulsion examples: 7
- Dataset candidates: 12
- CMU measurement status: blocked
- Long-haul infeasible cases: 4

## Feasibility Blockers

- No comparable audited pack-level aviation battery measurements are available.
- CMU eVTOL source is cell-level evidence and cannot prove pack sufficiency.
- Manufacturer examples are context records with mixed official/third-party boundaries.
- Long-haul feasibility remains simulation-only and expected-infeasible under current assumptions.
- Candidate ranking is blocked until uncertainty, safety, cycle-life, and system boundaries are audited.

## Collaboration Asks

- Fund data curation, parser audits, and reproducible external validation before scoring.
- Prioritize pack-level safety and thermal evidence over unsupported energy-density claims.
- Track phase gates by evidence readiness rather than optimistic leaderboard progress.
